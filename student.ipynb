    "\"As a data scientist analyzing the movie industry, my business understanding is that the movie industry is a complex ecosystem that involves various stakeholders, including studios, production companies, distributors, exhibitors, and audiences. The success of a movie depends on several factors, including the quality of the script, the star power of the actors, the marketing campaign, the release date, and the competition from other movies. Certain genres tend to perform better than others. For example, action and adventure films tend to perform well at the box office, while documentaries and foreign language films may have limited appeal to mainstream audiences.\\n\",\n"
